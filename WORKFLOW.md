# Workflow: Collecting NL–SPARQL Pairs for Musicological Knowledge Graphs

This repository provides a **reproducible pipeline for collecting, testing, and curating natural-language question–SPARQL query pairs** for musicological Knowledge Graphs (KGs). The resulting dataset is intended for evaluation, benchmarking, and ingestion into systems such as **Quagga**.

The workflow deliberately separates **configuration/selection**, **deterministic processing**, and **LLM-assisted interpretation** to support auditability and long-term maintainability.

---

## Workflow At A Glance

At a high level, the pipeline works like this:

1. Define which KGs to process in `seeds.yaml`.
2. Collect deterministic KG source snapshots into `kgs.jsonl` and `kg_sources/`, with provenance attached.
3. Extract candidate SPARQL queries from repos, docs, and PDFs into `kg_queries.jsonl`.
4. Enrich those query records with nearby human-readable evidence such as comments, query descriptions, and competency questions.
5. Run the queries against endpoints or local dumps and record execution metadata.
6. Build LLM input payloads from the curated query records.
7. Generate natural-language questions and confidence judgments with schema-constrained LLM output.
8. Merge LLM results back into `kg_queries.jsonl` for downstream evaluation and curation.

The intent is to keep every step inspectable: deterministic collection and execution happen first, and LLM interpretation happens only after provenance and run metadata are already attached.

---

## 1. Design Principles

- **YAML = selection plane**  
  Specifies processing scope and source locations

- **JSONL = curated outputs**  
  One record per line for KGs and NL–SPARQL pairs

- **Python = truth layer**  
  Repository cloning, SPARQL execution, timeouts, provenance capture, and filtering.

- **LLMs = language and interpretation layer**  
  KG descriptions, natural-language questions, confidence estimates.

This separation reduces hidden state, supports regeneration, and preserves dataset defensibility.

---

## 2. Seed Definition (`seeds.yaml`)

**Purpose:** define which KGs to process and where their technical resources live.

Each KG entry typically includes:

- `kg_id` (stable identifier)
- human-readable name
- short `description_hint` (prompt hint, not authoritative)
- SPARQL endpoint (if available)
- repository URLs (one or more)
- optional documentation links
- priority and notes

Example:

    kgs:
      - kg_id: meetups
        name: Polifonia MEETUPS Knowledge Graph
        project: Polifonia
        description_hint: >
          Musical encounters and collaborations extracted from
          musician biographies (c. 1800–1945).
        sparql:
          endpoint: https://polifonia.disi.unibo.it/meetups/sparql
          auth: none
        repos:
          - https://github.com/polifonia-project/meetups-kg

`seeds.yaml` is version-controlled and changes infrequently.

---

## 3. Data Model (Schemas)

To make provenance and QA explicit, we use **two JSONL files**:

- `kgs.jsonl`: one record per KG (metadata, endpoints, datasets)
- `kg_queries.jsonl`: one record per query (SPARQL, evidence, NL artifacts, run metadata)

### `kgs.jsonl` (KG metadata)

Each line is a JSON object. Example:

    {
      "kg_id": "meetups",
      "name": "Polifonia MEETUPS Knowledge Graph",
      "project": "Polifonia",
      "description": "...authoritative KG summary...",
      "sparql": {
        "endpoint": "https://polifonia.disi.unibo.it/meetups/sparql",
        "auth": "none",
        "graph": null
      },
      "dataset": {
        "dump_url": null,
        "local_path": null,
        "format": null
      },

          "source_path": "README.md",
          "error": null
        }
      ]
    }

### `kg_queries.jsonl` (query-centric record)

One record per query, with provenance and run history:

    {
      "query_id": "musow__sha256:abc123...",
      "query_label": "musow-0001",
      "kg_id": "musow",

        }
        {
          "evidence_id": "e2",
          "type": "cq_item",
          "source_url": "https://github.com/.../queries",
          "source_path": "README.md",
          "repo_commit": "abc123",
          "snippet": "CQ1 - Where did the concert take place?",
          "extracted_at": "2026-01-30",
          "extractor_version": "extract_queries.py@v1"
        }
      ],
      "confidence": null,
      "llm_output": {
        "ranked_evidence_phrases": [],
        "nl_question": null,
        "nl_question_origin": {

        "ran_at": "2026-01-29T10:40:00Z",
        "status": "ok",
        "endpoint": "https://polifonia.disi.unibo.it/meetups/sparql",
        "result_count": 14,
        "sample_row": {"s": "..."},
        "duration_ms": 1200
      },
      "run_history": [
        {
          "ran_at": "2026-01-29T10:40:00Z",
          "status": "ok",
          "endpoint": "https://...",
          "duration_ms": 1200
        }
      ]
    }

Notes:

- `evidence` is the place for raw extractions of NL evidence from repos/websites/docs/papers.
- `confidence` is a combined score (LLM confidence + runnability + heuristics).
- `llm_output` stores the generated NL question, provenance, and LLM confidence.
- `latest_run` and `latest_successful_run` are convenience fields; `run_history` is optional. These run-related fields are populated by `run_queries.py` in-place.
- Repo-derived evidence may also record `repo_checkout_mode` and `repo_default_branch` so reuse of an existing local checkout is explicit in provenance.

## 4. KG Source Capture (`kgs.jsonl`)

**Objective:** produce KG records with deterministic source snapshots and explicit provenance.

### Inputs

- `seeds.yaml`
- KG README files
- project websites
- related academic papers (abstracts or introductions)

### Process

For each KG:

1. Collect textual sources deterministically.
2. Resolve GitHub README and GitHub `blob/...` documentation URLs to commit-pinned raw URLs when possible.
3. Save source snapshots under `kg_sources/`.
4. Record provenance in `kgs.jsonl` via `source_urls`, `source_files`, and `source_details`.

Generated KG descriptions are an optional downstream step, not part of the current deterministic `build_kgs.py` implementation.

### Output

`kgs.jsonl`, one KG per line, for example:

    {
      "kg_id": "meetups",
      "name": "Polifonia MEETUPS Knowledge Graph",
      "description": "...",
      "sparql": {
        "endpoint": "https://...",
        "auth": "none",
        "graph": null
      },
      "repos": ["https://github.com/..."],
      "source_details": [
        {
          "source_url": "https://github.com/...",
          "resolved_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../<commit>/README.md",
          "repo_commit": "<commit>",
          "source_path": "README.md",
          "error": null
        }
      ]
    }

---

## 5. SPARQL Query Extraction (`kg_queries.jsonl`)

**Objective:** collect all candidate SPARQL queries with full provenance, without interpretation.

### Inputs

- repositories listed in `seeds.yaml`
- documentation pages with example queries
- academic papers containing SPARQL or competency questions (CQs)

### Process 

- Clone repositories.
- Record whether each query came from a fresh clone or a reused local checkout.
- Extract:
  - `.rq` and `.sparql` files
  - embedded SPARQL in code or documentation
- Normalise whitespace and prefixes.
- Deduplicate by hash.
- Record provenance:
  - repository URL
  - file path
  - commit hash
  - checkout mode (`fresh_clone` or `reused_local_clone`)
  - repository default branch (when available)
  - line spans (if available)

### Output

`kg_queries.jsonl` (query records with raw SPARQL, clean SPARQL, and evidence)

No filtering or LLM use occurs at this stage.

---

## 6. Evidence Enrichment (`kg_queries.jsonl`)

**Objective:** enrich query records with human-readable evidence from sources, preserving provenance and evidence types.

### Inputs

- `kg_queries.jsonl`
- repositories listed in `seeds.yaml`
- documentation pages and websites (optional)
- academic papers (PDFs, optional)

### Process (deterministic)

Extraction targets and evidence types:

- **Repo files**
  - `.rq`/`.sparql` comments directly above queries → `query_comment`
  - fenced `sparql` blocks in Markdown with the nearest preceding paragraph → `readme_query_desc`
  - raw file provenance → `repo_file`
- **Web/docs (HTML/MD)**
  - fenced/preformatted `sparql` blocks with the nearest preceding text block → `web_query_desc` / `doc_query_desc`
  - competency questions listed in headings, bullet lists, or tables → `cq_item`
- **PDF papers**
  - SPARQL code blocks in running text → `doc_query_desc` from the nearest preceding paragraphs
  - SPARQL code embedded in tables/figures/algorithms → capture the table/figure/algorithm as a query; attach the caption as `doc_query_desc`
  - competency question sections or tables (including captioned tables) → `cq_item`

All evidence items carry `evidence_id`, `source_url`, `source_path`, timestamps, and extractor version metadata. Repo-derived evidence also carries `repo_commit`, and may carry `repo_checkout_mode` and `repo_default_branch`.

### Output

`kg_queries.jsonl` (updated in-place with evidence items)

---

## 7. Query Execution And Run Metadata (`kg_queries.jsonl`)

**Objective:** record execution metadata for queries against endpoints or local dumps.

### Inputs

- `kg_queries.jsonl`
- SPARQL endpoints from `seeds.yaml` (plus fallbacks, if configured)
- local dataset dumps when no endpoint is available

### Process (deterministic)

For each query:

- Execute against the endpoint with a timeout; if configured, attempt fallbacks.
- For local dumps:
  - load the dump into an in-process SPARQL engine
  - execute the query against the local dataset
- Record:
  - execution status (`ok`, `empty`, `timeout`, `parse_error`, `auth`, etc.)
  - timestamp
  - endpoint used (or local dump path)
  - optional first result row
- Store `latest_run`, `latest_successful_run`, and append to `run_history`.

### Output

`kg_queries.jsonl` (updated in-place with run metadata)

This step establishes **ground-truth executability** for each query record.

---

## 8. Natural-Language Question And Confidence Generation

**Objective:** create human-readable NL–SPARQL pairs with confidence estimates.

### Inputs

- `kg_queries.jsonl`
- KG descriptions from `kgs.jsonl`
- optional sample result rows
- prompt + schema files in `prompts/` and `schemas/`

### Process (LLM with schema enforcement)

1. Build inputs with `build_llm_inputs.py` → `llm_inputs.jsonl`.
2. Run LLM generation with `run_llm_generation.py` → `llm_outputs.jsonl`.
3. Merge outputs with `merge_llm_outputs.py` → `kg_queries.jsonl` (updates in-place).

Current implementation notes:

- `run_llm_generation.py` defaults to `llm_inputs.jsonl`.
- `llm_outputs.jsonl` is treated as JSONL; legacy JSON-array files are normalized to JSONL on read.
- Output records carry a `run_signature` containing hashes of the effective prompt/schema/examples/input configuration.
- Resume/skip behavior uses `query_id`, `query_label`, `kg_id`, `model`, `system_prompt_hash`, and `input_hash`.

For each runnable query, generate an object of the following form (stored in `llm_output`):

    {
      "ranked_evidence_phrases": [
        {
          "text": "...",
          "evidence_id": "e12",
          "source_type": "query_comment",
          "rank": 1,
          "verbatim": true
        }
      ],
      "nl_question": "...",
      "nl_question_origin": {
        "mode": "verbatim|paraphrased|generated",
        "evidence_ids": ["e12", "e7"],
        "primary_evidence_id": "e12"
      },
      "confidence": 92,
      "confidence_rationale": "...",
      "needs_review": false
    }

Guidelines:

- Prefer **clear, concise phrasing**.
- Avoid ontology jargon unless unavoidable.
- Lower confidence if semantics are ambiguous.

### Evidence prioritization for LLM input

Provide the full evidence list to the LLM and specify a preference order by type:

1. `query_comment` (SPARQL comments)
2. `doc_query_desc` / `web_query_desc` / `readme_query_desc`
3. `cq_item`
4. general KG descriptions (`kg_summary`, `doc_summary`, `readme_summary`, `web_summary`, `repo_summary`)

A second **consistency-check pass** may be applied to downgrade overconfident pairs.

### Output

`llm_outputs.jsonl` (versioned JSONL LLM results with `run_signature`) and `kg_queries.jsonl` (updated in-place).

---

## 9. Academic Paper Integration (Parallel Track)

For each KG:

- Identify canonical papers.
- Extract:
  - SPARQL examples
  - competency questions (CQs)

If only CQs exist:

- Optionally draft SPARQL (marked as `crafted_from_cq`).
- Assign lower confidence unless verified against an endpoint.

Paper-derived queries pass through the **same pipeline** as repo-derived ones.

---

## 10. Outputs And Intended Use

At minimum, the project produces:

- `seeds.yaml` – configuration input
- `kgs.jsonl` – KG catalogue 
- `kg_queries.jsonl` – validated queries with run metadata and `llm_output`
- `llm_inputs.jsonl` – LLM input payloads
- `llm_outputs.jsonl` – LLM outputs (before merge)

These outputs may be:

- ingested into Quagga
- used for evaluation or benchmarking
- published as a dataset
- extended with additional KGs

---

## 11. Rationale

- Every artefact is reproducible.
- Every query is runnable or explicitly marked otherwise.
- Every NL question has an explicit confidence estimate.
- Provenance is preserved end-to-end.
- LLM use is restricted to tasks where it adds value (language, summarisation).
